# CompositeObservableCollection

Why a composite collection for observable collections.

The reason to create such a special type of observable collection was that some UI-Controls of thrid party does not support the integrated CompositeCollection of .Net.

And to make a functional solution without changing the UI-Controls i implement such a special type of observable collection.
